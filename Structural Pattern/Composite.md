# Composite Design Pattern
- Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.

# Implementation
We have a class Employee which acts as composite pattern actor class. CompositePatternDemo, our demo class will use Employee class to add department level hierarchy and print all employees.

# Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Employee {
   private String name;
   private String dept;
   private int salary;
   private List<Employee> subordinates;

   // constructor
   public Employee(String name,String dept, int sal) {
      this.name = name;
      this.dept = dept;
      this.salary = sal;
      subordinates = new ArrayList<Employee>();
   }

   public void add(Employee e) {
      subordinates.add(e);
   }

   public void remove(Employee e) {
      subordinates.remove(e);
   }

   public List<Employee> getSubordinates(){
     return subordinates;
   }

   public String toString(){
      return ("Employee :[ Name : " + name + ", dept : " + dept + ", salary :" + salary+" ]");
   }   
}
```

Client
```java
public class CompositePatternDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      Employee CEO = new Employee("John","CEO", 30000);

      Employee headSales = new Employee("Robert","Head Sales", 20000);

      Employee headMarketing = new Employee("Michel","Head Marketing", 20000);

      Employee clerk1 = new Employee("Laura","Marketing", 10000);
      Employee clerk2 = new Employee("Bob","Marketing", 10000);

      Employee salesExecutive1 = new Employee("Richard","Sales", 10000);
      Employee salesExecutive2 = new Employee("Rob","Sales", 10000);

      CEO.add(headSales);
      CEO.add(headMarketing);

      headSales.add(salesExecutive1);
      headSales.add(salesExecutive2);

      headMarketing.add(clerk1);
      headMarketing.add(clerk2);

      //print all employees of the organization
      System.out.println(CEO); 
      
      for (Employee headEmployee : CEO.getSubordinates()) {
         System.out.println(headEmployee);
         
         for (Employee employee : headEmployee.getSubordinates()) {
            System.out.println(employee);
         }
      }		
   }
}
```

# Pros
- You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.

# Cons
- It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
