# Decorator Design Pattern
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

Extending a class is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to alter an object’s behavior. However, inheritance has several serious caveats that you need to be aware of.

    Inheritance is static. You can’t alter the behavior of an existing object at runtime. You can only replace the whole object with another one that’s created from a different subclass.
    Subclasses can have just one parent class. In most languages, inheritance doesn’t let a class inherit behaviors of multiple classes at the same time.

One of the ways to overcome these caveats is by using Aggregation or Composition 
instead of Inheritance. Both of the alternatives work almost the same way: one object has a reference to another and delegates it some work, whereas with inheritance, the object itself is able to do that work, inheriting the behavior from its superclass.

# Code
```java

// The component interface defines operations that can be
// altered by decorators.
interface DataSource is
    method writeData(data)
    method readData():data

// Concrete components provide default implementations for the
// operations. There might be several variations of these
// classes in a program.
class FileDataSource implements DataSource is
    constructor FileDataSource(filename) { ... }

    method writeData(data) is
        // Write data to file.

    method readData():data is
        // Read data from file.

// The base decorator class follows the same interface as the
// other components. The primary purpose of this class is to
// define the wrapping interface for all concrete decorators.
// The default implementation of the wrapping code might include
// a field for storing a wrapped component and the means to
// initialize it.
class DataSourceDecorator implements DataSource is
    protected field wrappee: DataSource

    constructor DataSourceDecorator(source: DataSource) is
        wrappee = source

    // The base decorator simply delegates all work to the
    // wrapped component. Extra behaviors can be added in
    // concrete decorators.
    method writeData(data) is
        wrappee.writeData(data)

    // Concrete decorators may call the parent implementation of
    // the operation instead of calling the wrapped object
    // directly. This approach simplifies extension of decorator
    // classes.
    method readData():data is
        return wrappee.readData()

// Concrete decorators must call methods on the wrapped object,
// but may add something of their own to the result. Decorators
// can execute the added behavior either before or after the
// call to a wrapped object.
class EncryptionDecorator extends DataSourceDecorator is
    method writeData(data) is
        // 1. Encrypt passed data.
        // 2. Pass encrypted data to the wrappee's writeData
        // method.

    method readData():data is
        // 1. Get data from the wrappee's readData method.
        // 2. Try to decrypt it if it's encrypted.
        // 3. Return the result.

// You can wrap objects in several layers of decorators.
class CompressionDecorator extends DataSourceDecorator is
    method writeData(data) is
        // 1. Compress passed data.
        // 2. Pass compressed data to the wrappee's writeData
        // method.

    method readData():data is
        // 1. Get data from the wrappee's readData method.
        // 2. Try to decompress it if it's compressed.
        // 3. Return the result.


// Option 1. A simple example of a decorator assembly.
class Application is
    method dumbUsageExample() is
        source = new FileDataSource("somefile.dat")
        source.writeData(salaryRecords)
        // The target file has been written with plain data.

        source = new CompressionDecorator(source)
        source.writeData(salaryRecords)
        // The target file has been written with compressed
        // data.

        source = new EncryptionDecorator(source)
        // The source variable now contains this:
        // Encryption > Compression > FileDataSource
        source.writeData(salaryRecords)
        // The file has been written with compressed and
        // encrypted data.

```

# Pros
- You can extend an object’s behavior without making a new subclass.
- You can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime.
- You can combine several behaviors by wrapping an object into multiple decorators.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can divide a monolithic class that implements many possible variants of behavior into several smaller classes.

# Cons
-  It’s hard to remove a specific wrapper from the wrappers stack.
- It’s hard to implement a decorator in such a way that its behavior doesn’t depend on the order in the decorators stack.
- The initial configuration code of layers might look pretty ugly.
